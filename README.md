## Things Learned

- First usage of `useContext` library. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

- More practice with `fetch()`. The fetch() function is a modern JavaScript API for making network requests (HTTP requests) to servers. 

- Further implementation of React tools, including `useCallback`, `useState`, and `useEffect`

- Good practice adjusting React/JS rules based on size of board.

## Future Improvements

- Nail down responsiveness (in browser looks and functions well, on my phone its weird?)
- Stats page to track how a user is doing would be nice, similar to current Wordle
